# Proper Projects

This project/repo is a collection of projects I've created that could be considered "complete" or otherwise a proper release is available.

At the time of writing, the way I intend to organize these are as git submodules.

## CLI Apps

Apps that are meant to be run from a CLI.

- [clipboard-cli](../../../cli)
  - A fork of the original clipboard-clip which is used for distribution.
- [homebrew-clipboard-cli][1]
  - A repo for publishing clipboard-cli to homebrew.
- [PassGen][2]
  - A CLI utility for generating random password phrases.
- [Sebastian][3]
  - My timekeeping assistant.
- [SQ-Aid][4]
  - A CLI utility for interacting with the SonarQube API.

## Front End

These are the various websites I've created.

- [4lch4.com][5]
  - My personal homepage from a while back.
- [cheatsheets][6]
  - A fork of the cheatsheets website with some custom additions.

## Libs

A collection of libraries that are written to be used by other modules.

- [@4lch4/logger][7]
  - A light logger utility for logging to stdout or disk.

## Templates

A collection of template projects that are to be used to bootstrap a future project.

- [NPM-Module-Template][8]
  - This is a template repository for creating a new npm module, whether or not I intend to publish it there. There's a few li'l things I make sure to do upon creating a new project that I'm tired of remembering and making sure I don't miss, so that's what this is for.
  - To be deprecated after I finish the following template for TypeScript.
- [TypeScript-Module-Template][9]
  - A template repository for a TypeScript Module.

## Web Services

A collection of APIs/microservices to be hosted on a server.

- [Ansel][10]
  - An image modifier/creator to be used by Tron.
- [Metanoia][11]
  - Converts IP addresses to Battle.net regions.
- [TPolls][12]
  - For managing polls.
